Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Rui Dong, a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University Medical Center. With a focus on statistical genetics, I am part of the Center for Statistical Genetics at the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center and the Department of Neurology. I work on unraveling the complex genetic underpinnings of neurological diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, through innovative statistical methods.

My academic journey began at Sun Yat-sen University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I then pursued my Ph.D. at Tsinghua University, focusing on genome-scale analysis using alignment-free approaches based on the 1000 Genomes Project. This work laid the foundation for my current research, which integrates large-scale genomic data with advanced statistical techniques to uncover genetic associations and interactions. During these years, I have also presented my research at various international conferences and published in leading scientific journals.

In addition to my research, I have a passion for teaching and have served as a teaching assistant for numerous courses at Tsinghua University. I am also a reviewer for several academic journals, contributing to the scientific community by ensuring the quality and rigor of published research.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work, publications, and contributions to the field of statistical genetics. Thank you for visiting!
